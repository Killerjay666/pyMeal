This file contains example meals for the meal planner app.

Add them in an ordered fashion, as such:
meals = [
 Meal("Order sushi", "www.ordersushi.com"),
 Meal("Grilled chicken", "https://example.com/grilled-chicken"),
]

If you struggle with inspiration, feed the above into your favorite generative AI app
and ask it to generate a list for you
